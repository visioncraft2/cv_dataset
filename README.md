可用于缺陷检测的公开数据集：

## MVTec AD 

Paper: MVTec AD –a comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection

It consists of 5 categories, i.e. breakfast box, juice bottle, pushpins, screw bag and splicing connectors. The MVTec AD dataset contains 3,629 training images and 1,725 test images

## MVTec LOCO

Paper: Beyond dents and scratches: Logical constraints in unsupervised anomaly detection and localization.

The dataset comprises approximately 3,644 images, distributed as 1,772 images for training, 304 for validation and 1,568 for testing.

## VisA 

Paper: Spot-the-difference self-supervised pretraining for anomaly detection and segmentation.

The VisA dataset consists of 9,621 normal and 1,200 anomalous color images encompassing 12 objects across 3 domains, including complex structure, single instance and multiple instances. The anomalous images exhibit various flaws, including surface defects such as
scratches, dents, color spots or cracks, and logical defects
like misplacement or missing parts.

## MPDD 

Deep learning-based defect detection of metal parts: evaluating current methods in complex conditions.
